        <h2>Why Cultural Context Matters</h2>
        <p>Language is deeply intertwined with culture. To truly understand Arabic text, NLP systems need to recognize cultural references, idioms, traditions, and social norms that shape how people communicate.</p>
        
        <p>Cultural context is especially important in Arabic because of the language's rich history, religious significance, and the diverse cultures across the Arab world.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="topic-card">
        <h2>Cultural Elements in Arabic Language</h2>
        <p>Several cultural elements influence Arabic language use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Religious References:</strong> Phrases from the Quran and Hadith are commonly used in everyday speech</li>
          <li><strong>Poetic Tradition:</strong> References to classical Arabic poetry and literature</li>
          <li><strong>Hospitality Expressions:</strong> Elaborate greetings and phrases related to generosity</li>
          <li><strong>Respect Forms:</strong> Different ways of addressing people based on age, status, and relationship</li>
          <li><strong>Proverbs and Sayings:</strong> Region-specific wisdom passed through generations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cultural Context Explorer</h3>
        <p>This interactive element would allow you to explore how cultural context affects meaning in Arabic. In a real interactive version, you could see examples of phrases that require cultural knowledge to understand.</p>
        
        <div class="cultural-context-examples">
          <p><strong>Example 1: Greeting Responses</strong></p>
          <p>When someone says "كيف حالك؟" (How are you?), a common response is "الحمد لله" (Praise be to God).</p>
          <p>Cultural Context: This response reflects the Islamic value of gratitude to God regardless of one's actual condition.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Example 2: Expressions of Admiration</strong></p>
          <p>When complimenting something, people often say "ما شاء الله" (What God has willed).</p>
          <p>Cultural Context: This phrase is used to express admiration while avoiding the "evil eye" - a cultural belief that excessive praise without acknowledging God might bring misfortune.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Example 3: Hospitality</strong></p>
          <p>The phrase "البيت بيتك" (My house is your house) is commonly used when welcoming guests.</p>
          <p>Cultural Context: This reflects the high value placed on hospitality in Arab culture, where guests are treated with great generosity.</p>

        <h2>Challenges for NLP</h2>
        <p>Cultural context creates several challenges for Arabic NLP:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understanding idioms and expressions that don't translate literally</li>
          <li>Recognizing when religious phrases are used in secular contexts</li>
          <li>Interpreting humor, which is often culturally specific</li>
          <li>Detecting subtle cultural references in text</li>
          <li>Accounting for regional cultural differences across the Arab world</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Arabic has dozens of words for "love" with subtle differences in meaning, reflecting the cultural importance of expressing different types and degrees of affection appropriately!</p>

        <h2>Unique Characteristics of Arabic</h2>
        <p>Arabic has several unique features that make it both challenging and fascinating for NLP:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rich Morphology:</strong> Arabic words are formed from roots with patterns of vowels and consonants</li>
          <li><strong>Diacritics:</strong> Small marks that can completely change word meaning</li>
          <li><strong>Right-to-Left Script:</strong> Different from many other languages</li>
          <li><strong>Diglossia:</strong> Significant differences between formal (Modern Standard Arabic) and spoken dialects</li>
          <li><strong>Context Sensitivity:</strong> Word meaning often heavily depends on context</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="topic-card">
        <h2>Arabic Morphology</h2>
        <p>Arabic has a root-and-pattern morphology system. Most words are derived from a three-consonant root that carries the basic meaning:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Root: ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) relates to writing</li>
          <li>كَتَبَ (kataba) = he wrote</li>
          <li>كِتَاب (kitāb) = book</li>
          <li>مَكْتَبَة (maktaba) = library</li>
          <li>كَاتِب (kātib) = writer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This system allows Arabic to create many words from a single root, but makes computational analysis more complex.</p>

        <h3>Explore Arabic Word Formation</h3>
        <p>This interactive element would allow you to see how different Arabic words are formed from the same root. In a real interactive version, you could select different roots and see the derived words.</p>
        
        <div class="word-formation-example">
          <p><strong>Root: د-ر-س (d-r-s) - related to studying</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>دَرَسَ (darasa) = he studied</li>
            <li>دَرَّسَ (darrasa) = he taught</li>
            <li>مَدْرَسَة (madrasa) = school</li>
            <li>دِرَاسَة (dirāsa) = study/education</li>
            <li>مُدَرِّس (mudarris) = teacher</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <div class="topic-card">
        <h2>Challenges for Arabic NLP</h2>
        <p>Processing Arabic text with computers presents several challenges:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Word Segmentation:</strong> Determining word boundaries can be difficult</li>
          <li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> The same written form can have multiple meanings without diacritics</li>
          <li><strong>Dialectal Variation:</strong> Significant differences between regional dialects</li>
          <li><strong>Resource Scarcity:</strong> Fewer digital resources compared to languages like English</li>
          <li><strong>Code-Switching:</strong> Mixing of Arabic with other languages, especially in social media</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Arabic has influenced many other languages! Words like "algebra," "algorithm," "coffee," and "sugar" all have Arabic origins.</p>
